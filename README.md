    r/Place
</h1>

The project was a recreation of Reddit's r/Place, an online canvas that anyone can draw on. Each user can only colour 1 pixel every 5 minutes.

The project was meant to be deployed on AWS, using ECS. DynamoDB was used as the database, and Redis was used as a caching service.

Full detail is described in the report.
